  <p class="body">Fart Sounds is a fun little podcast by <a href="http://john.design">John Choura</a>. Episodes consist of interviews with people being asked to <i>describe</i> and <i>perform</i> their favorite fart sound. Although it might seem a little immature, just think about it... <i>farts are the great equalizer</i>. Everyone does it. Not one person could ever say that they haven't.</p>

  <p class="body">It's this shows mission to help bring a little absurdity and joy into the world, and <i>make people laugh one fart sound at a time</i>.</p>
